# Django and Vue-based "Play2Learn" Website with SQL 

This is a website that: 

1. Allows users to track their "Math Facts" and "Anagram Hunt" game scores, see leaderboards, create profiles, log-in/out, change passwords, and more.

2. Allows administrators to run the site and alter every aspect of it via Django Admin.


# To run:

activate venv in root folder

install requirements.txt, THEN requirements2.txt (requirements2 MUST overwrite requirements1)

keys and passwords available upon request OR manually setup the CSV files instead of using SQL
